## Hi! 👋

This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

## Purpose 🤔

My intent for this blog is for it to be fully **Open Source**.

You can check all the commits [on the Github Repository](https://github.com/doppelganger9/blog).

It is built with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and ⚛️**React**.

## Building

I will post here at first to explain & illustrate technicall stuff while building this blog, instead of using vague example use-cases.

I like being pragmatic & practical and I want to show this!

Also, I want to show you the meandering in finding a working thing, take a ride with me instead of just showing you the perfected result.

## Contact

At first I wanted to add the possibility to comment on posts, but if you really want to contribute or interact with me or this blog, choose whatever suits you:

- my DMs are open on twitter:
