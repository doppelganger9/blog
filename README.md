This blog is made with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

I was inspired by all the hype around it and GraphQL and starting a technical blog in general.

## Open source

You can follow in the commit history how I adapted the [Gastby-starter-blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/) to grow my own thing.

I will add posts via Pull Request to myself to refine them before publishing, so you'll be able to follow this process.
I encourage your curiosity and will be delighted if you can fix my poor English grammar or whatever deeper in the content I will post.

## CI/CD

I'm an automation advocate, I [wrote a post](https://lacourt.dev/2019/03/06/) about setting up the Github Actions Workflow for this blog.

The website is deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
