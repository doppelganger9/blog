I am writing this post from a [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) environment, launched directly from my blog's repository URL.

You can try this just now: [https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/doppelganger9/blog](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/doppelganger9/blog)

Did you see how easy and smart it is to just add `https://gitpod.io/#` in front of your GitHub repo to launch the environment ü§ì?

Ok, time to make it trippy:

## What is this?

As you see, the idea is to have a **VisualStudio Code in the browser development environment** bootstrapped from your repository.

To be more precise, it is based on [Theia IDE](https://www.theia-ide.org/)

### extensions

It does not come with your collection of VSCode Extensions, but it is enough useful for 95% of the time.

### network stability

It has a few disconnecting moments.

### exposing a local web server

It can expose ports like when you need to run your dev web server, it is possible and really frictionless.

### closing files

Whoops, If like me you are used to hitting `CMD + W` on VSCode to close files, this will not work here, because it will close the browser tab! üò±
Hopefully, opening back https://gitpod.io shows my workspaces and the one I accidentally closed is still running and I can reopen it in the state it was (process running, etc.) which is well thought!

### üí∏

Don't forget to stop your workspaces, the free tier gives you 100 Hours which is really sufficient for my kind of usage: working on Github Repositories outside of working hours.

## This integration test is failing ü§≠

After I finished writing the first draft of this post, I tried to `git push`, but I encountered this error:
```
 ! [remote rejected]  ... (refusing to allow an integration to create .github/main.workflow)
```

GitHub rejects my push because it seems that when you [enable Github Actions](../2019/03/06/) it blocks all other GitHub Integrations from working. And Gitpod is one such Integration.

Well... again not everything is üåà and ü¶Ñ.

Damn, after a little search, it seems there really is an issue about this.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="fr"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh once you enable <a href="https://twitter.com/github?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GitHub</a> Actions on a repo no other integration will work. For example trying to push a git tag using a deploy key will error out with: &quot;refusing to allow an integration to create .github/main.workflow&quot;</p>&mdash; Stefan Prodan (@stefanprodan) <a href="https://twitter.com/stefanprodan/status/1089848015626686465?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">28 janvier 2019</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="fr"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes, it&#39;s a bug, and we&#39;re working on a fix.  There are security reasons not to let integrations write to main.workflow, but our current version of this check may be too restrictive.  Thanks for the report.</p>&mdash; Patrick Reynolds (@p_reynolds) <a href="https://twitter.com/p_reynolds/status/1089880487659737088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">28 janvier 2019</a></blockquote>

### Partial fix and git-fu ü•ã

I could not resolve myself to neither remove Github Actions nor drop using Gitpod!

So I...

- `git stash`-ed my uncommitted changes,
- `git checkout -` to leave the git branch I had dedicated for this post and come back to the previous one (`git checkout master` also works, but 5 more characters to type? Meh.)
- `git cherry-pick`-ed the commits I did, not knowing the `push` rejection issue,
- `git push` worked üéâ from `master`, so I knew I would not have to copy all my changes out of Gitpod to my local computer,
- `git stash pop`-ped and proceeded from here to continue writing this paragraph and push it live!

## Conclusion

So, as I've experienced sort of an emotional rollercoaster,
at a moment I thought that even though I really liked the idea of having a *"remote VS Code in the browser"* and in the past had found it very useful,
combining this with Github Actions had ruined it. But pushing from `master` did the trick!

I hope you learned a few things or at least witnessed how I bump against issues and go on ü§£.
