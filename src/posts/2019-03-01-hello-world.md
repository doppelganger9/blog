## Hi! 👋

This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

## Purpose 🤔

### Open Source

My intent for this blog is for it to be fully **Open Source**.

You can check all the commits [on the Github Repository](https://github.com/doppelganger9/blog).

### Tech stack

At first, I built it with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and ⚛️**React**.

#### and migrations

Since then, it has been migrated to [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev), powered by [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). And now, [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction)!

## Building

I will post here at first to explain & illustrate technicall stuff while building this blog, instead of using vague example use-cases.

I like being pragmatic & practical and I want to show this!

Also, I want to show you the meandering in finding a working thing, take a ride with me instead of just showing you the perfected result.

## Frequency

I intended to post at least once in a while. Oh, wow, now _that_ is ambition! 🤪

## Contact

At first I wanted to [add the possibility to comment on posts](/2021/11/28), but if you really want to contribute or interact with me or this blog, choose whatever suits you:

- mail me at [david@lacourt.dev](mailto://david@lacourt.dev)

- I don't use Twitter/X anymore...
