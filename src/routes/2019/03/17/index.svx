Unearthing some old tweet to share with you today:

## Observable HQ

> a magic notebook for visualization.

[Check the introduction](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/five-minute-introduction) for yourself: it is something that you need to manipulate to better understand (a.k.a. *Kinesthetic learning*).

You may have noticed from [previous](/2019/03/14) [posts](/2019/03/16) that I'm really fond of the Fun Fun Function YouTube channel.

Inspired by [MPJ](https://twitter.com/mpjme), I tried to use the [ObservableHQ website](https://observablehq.com/) to do some kind of literate programming or expressive playground: combining code with text in a readable form.

Here is the result of this experiment from *October, 18th of 2018*.

## Using JavaScript Generators to create a time-traveling visualization of an algorithm

Link to this [Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@doppelganger9/algorithm-debugging-using-a-time-travelling-javascript-ge).

*I will try to embed it directly here, but for now, you'll have to visit the link above.*

## Conclusion

*Wow, that was a quick post. Unless you read the Notebook linked, that is.*

As always, I learned a ton on the way and ended up with nice executable documentation for a concept helping me visualize how algorithm work.

I hope you too learned a few things.
